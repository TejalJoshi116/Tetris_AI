 ## How to Run
 
 ### Requirements To Run
  - Python 3 *(tested with version 3.9.2)*
  - Pygame module *(tested with version 2.0.1)*

  #### Windows
  The latest version of python can be found [here](https://www.python.org/downloads/windows/). Choose the *Windows Installer (64 bit)*  and make sure to tick *Add Python to path*. Then to install the pygame module, open command prompt and enter the following:
  ```
  pip install pygame
  ```
  With above installed, download this repo. Either by git clone or manually downloading the zip and extracting. Then open command prompt, navigate to the tetris-selfplay directory and enter the following:
  ```
  python main.py
  ```
  #### Ubuntu 20.04
  Python 3.8.2 comes installed by default starting from Ubuntu 20.04.<br/> 
  To install the pygame module open terminal and enter the following in turn:
  ```
  sudo apt update
  sudo apt install python3-pygame
  ```
  With above installed, download this repo. Either by git clone or manually downloading the zip and extracting.<br/>
  Then open terminal, navigate to the tetris-selfplay directory and enter the following:
  ```
  python3 main.py
  ```
  #### Ubuntu 16.04 or 18.04
  The latest version of python available in the official Ubuntu repositories is older than the 3.7.7 version required for the pygame module.<br/>
  But you can install the latest python versions by adding the [deadsnakes PPA](https://launchpad.net/~deadsnakes).<br/>

  ```
  sudo apt install software-properties-common
  sudo add-apt-repository ppa:deadsnakes/ppa
  sudo apt update 
  sudo apt install python3.9
  ```
  Now python 3.9 is installed, you can install pygame using pip.
  ```
  sudo apt install python3-pip
  sudo pip install pygame
  ```
  With above installed, download this repo. Either by git clone or manually downloading the zip and extracting.<br/>
